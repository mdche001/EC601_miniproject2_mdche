      ·training.py: Training the model which is in model.py and test is also in this script.
      ·frozen.py: Freezing the trained model in miniproject2/logs/train, and creating a .pb file for the customer use.
      
    2. model body:
      ·which is stored in my loscalhost, coz the pipe always broke when I upload the model files to github.
